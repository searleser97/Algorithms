\subsection{What is a Binary Indexed Tree}

Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree is a data structure that can efficiently update
elements and compute prefix sums in an array.\\

It supports query and update in $O(lg(N))$ time with $O(N)$ space complexity.\\

It requires just a few lines of code!
